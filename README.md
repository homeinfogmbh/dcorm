# dcorm
A dataclasses-based ORM framework.

## [WIP] - Work in progress
This framework is currently under development. A first release will be announced
in this very README file.

## Credits
Thanks to @coleifer and his [peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee) framework
by whose work this rewrite has been inspired and is partially based upon.
